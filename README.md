# Filament
A simple ECS game engine for tiny-scope games.

## What is Filament?
Filament is a WIP ECS game engine for making smaller games. 
It's also a project I've wanted to build for a while now, and I've finally sat down and tried to do it.

Why ECS? I prefer composition over inheritance, and I'd like to play around with a simple ECS-esque system.

## What isn't Filament?
- A replacement for any established game engine (Unity, Unreal, Godot, etc.)
- A performance-focused game engine
- A "good" (performant, proper) ECS implementation

## Dependencies
- Make
- GLEW
- GLFW
- OpenGL 3.3

## Supported Platforms
- [x] Mac (x86_64)
- [ ] Max (ARM)
- [ ] Windows
- [ ] Linux
